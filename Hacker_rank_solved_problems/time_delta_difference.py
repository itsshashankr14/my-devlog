# When users post an update on social media, such as a URL, image, status update, etc.,
# other users in their network are able to view this post in their news feed.
# Users can also see exactly when the post was published â€” i.e., how many hours,
# minutes, or seconds ago.
#
# Since posts may be published and viewed in different time zones, the displayed
# time can be confusing. You are given two timestamps in the format:
# Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx
